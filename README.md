# Lab | Giving feedback on a project's planning, structure and contents

## Description

In this lab, you will assess whether your colleagues have done a good job planning their project, structuring their repository and documenting their code files. The main goal of the lab is simple: tell your colleagues if you could understand their work and why. 

Before starting the lab, you will be assigned a partner. 

Follow the guidelines below to review your partner's project. 

## Guidelines

1) Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to.

2) Read the README file. After reading it, can you answer these questions?
  - Is the goal of the project clear to you?
  Yes, if I know what we're talking about. That is, for a member of the course.
  No, if the person who reads it don't know anything about the course project.
  
  - Do you know what are the main questions that your partner wants to answer?
  I know the main goal but not the specific answers. 
 
  - Do you know your partners' hypotheses?
  I think that the hypotheses should not be in the readme, so the readme is correct written in this case. 
  
  - What is the source of the data that your partner is going to use?
  Yes, with a link to it. 
  
  - Has your partner defined any coding conventions?
  No, he missed to write them.
  
3) Take a look at the folder structure of your partner's repository.
  - Is there a clear folder structure?
  No, he missed to create folders and structure the files in them. 
  
  - If you had to look for the data files he used, would you be able to do it easily?
  Yes. Because there're only 6 files and all of them are well defined.
  
  - Does the repository include a .gitignore file?
  No, he missed it and because of that, there're some files related to Mac and to Jupyter Notebook.
  
4) Now, look for the coding files (.ipynb, .py, .json, ...).
  - Is it easy for you to know what part of the analysis each file contains?
  Yes, everything is in one file. Plus, the table of contents at the beginning of the main analysis file helps to navigate trought it.
  
  
  
  
  - If you open one of those files, is there any text that leads you through all the code (comments, markdown cells, …)?
  - Read one of those code files. Does it have a clear purpose? (e.g: scraping a web, cleaning the data, …) 
 
 Extra comments: 
 
 -Add an explanation at the beginning if you write comments for yourself.  
 - The code is clean and good looking. 
 - There're erros in the code. 
 - Mix 1980 and 2010
 - No definition of TBC.
 - Lack of main explanation in the firsts seccions. 
 - 1.1 & 1.2 Different scale of the axis for same graphs!
 - 2. No explanation p-value
 - 2.1 lack of y axis, budget/average
 - 3 graphs genres/profit -- should be profit/genres. Lack of y axis.
 - 3 genres vs return rate, lack of y axis.
 - 4 lack of explanation
 - 7- lack statistical explanation
 - good: add a link with more information.
 
 - Many areas missed an explanation of the general way of analysis he took.
 - lack of explanation for statistical results in some analysis. Others good.
 - lack of coherence in the graphs of all project.
 - Better if he had divided the anaylisis in several files.
 
5) Take a look at the commits.
  - Do the commits have a clear and understandable message? 
  Not really. They are a series of main file update but without information about each change.
  - Is your partner making enough commits? 
  Difficult to say. I would say yes, but he needs to explain more the changes in each commit. 

6) Ask your partner to send you his Trello link or to show you his Kanban Board. 
No needed to use it. 
  - Are the tasks well defined?
  - Is it updated?
 
### Deliverables
You don't need to deliver any files, just give your feedback on the repository to your partner. Tell him about your experience trying to understand his/her work taking into account what you saw in steps 1 to 6.
